**Description:**
The SonicScale Shifter is a dynamic module designed to be the heart of your Eurorack modular synthesizer, providing unparalleled control over control voltage (CV) signals. Tailored for precise transposition in semitone increments, this module is a sonic sculptor, allowing you to effortlessly shape the pitch of your sound sources with accuracy and finesse.

**Key Features:**

1. **CV Transposition Mastery:**
   The SonicScale Shifter boasts a dedicated control knob that empowers you to seamlessly transpose incoming CV signals. This intuitive interface allows for both subtle adjustments and dramatic shifts in pitch, providing a broad spectrum of creative possibilities.

2. **Semitone Magnitude Selector:**
   Explore the vastness of pitch modulation with the SonicScale's Semitone Magnitude Selector. This rotary switch allows you to precisely dial in the desired magnitude of semitone transposition, offering a wide range of musical expressions.

3. **Bi-Polar Sonic Exploration:**
   Delve into sonic landscapes with bi-polar transposition capabilities. The SonicScale Shifter supports both upward and downward transposition, giving you the tools to create complex and expressive pitch modulation for your compositions.

4. **CV Input and Attenuverter:**
   Elevate your sonic journey by incorporating external modulation sources through the CV input. The attenuverter provides nuanced control over the depth and direction of modulation, ensuring dynamic and evolving pitch changes that respond to your creative intent.

5. **Pitch-Perfect Tuning Reference:**
   The SonicScale Shifter incorporates a built-in pitch-perfect tuning reference, ensuring that your semitone transpositions maintain pitch integrity across your entire modular system. This feature is essential for achieving precise and harmonically rich results.

6. **LED Display Precision:**
   Stay in complete control with the LED display that visually represents the current transposition value. This real-time feedback enhances your ability to make precise adjustments, facilitating a seamless integration of the SonicScale Shifter into your modular setup.

7. **Compact Eurorack Form Factor:**
   Designed to seamlessly integrate into your Eurorack case, the SonicScale Shifter optimizes space without compromising on functionality. Its sleek design and user-friendly interface make it an indispensable tool for both beginners and experienced modular enthusiasts.

The SonicScale Shifter empowers you to explore uncharted musical territories, providing a versatile and precise means of transposing CV signals in semitone increments. Elevate your modular synthesis experience as you shape melodies, modulations, and sequences with unmatched precision and sonic finesse.
